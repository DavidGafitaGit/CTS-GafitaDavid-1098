Bachelor topic title:
	Stock Price Prediction System (Web application)
	
Description of the problem:
	The application allows administrators to generate reports based on stock information and the time selected for generation.
	This information will be received based on an analysis performed in the database. 
	The request for the reports can take a lot of time so the application will develop a solution that will increase
    the performance by cloning a certain report and filtering the clones after that by period.
	
Advantages of the solution:
    - this model is flexible in design;
    - it is easy to detect errors;
    - we can find missing functionality easily;
    - it can be reused by the developer for more complicated projects in the future.
	
Disadvantages of the solution:
    - there is certainty in determining the number of iterations;
    - there may be incomplete or inadequate problem analysis;
    - there may increase the complexity of the system.
