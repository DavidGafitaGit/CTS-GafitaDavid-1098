Bachelor topic title:
	Stock Price Prediction System (Web application)
	
Description of the problem:
	The application allows viewing volatile stocks and therefore we want to group them into several categories: stocks with higher volatility and stocks with low volatility. 
	In this case, we presented only those with high volatility.

Advantages of the solution:
	- Provides everything to display heavily nested object structures;
	- Lean, easy-to-understand program code.
	
Disadvantages of the solution:
	- Implementation of component interfaces is very challenging;
	- Subsequent adjustment of composite features is difficult and cumbersome to realize.
