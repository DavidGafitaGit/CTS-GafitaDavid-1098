Bachelor topic title:
	Stock Price Prediction System (Web application)
	
Description of the problem:
	The application allows you to view stocks that are limited to a certain value before they are closed.

Advantages of the solution:
	- The Flyweight Pattern contributes to improving the performance of the application by reducing the number of objects.
	- The Flyweight Pattern reduces the memory footprint and saving RAM as the common properties are shared between objects using Intrinsic properties.
	
Disadvantages of the solution:
	- If there are no shareable properties in an object, the pattern is of no use.
	- If memory is not a concern, implementing Flyweight design can be overkill for the application.
	- The pattern introduces code complexity.ct on unit testing procedures.
