Bachelor topic title:
	Stock Price Prediction System (Web application)
	
Description of the problem:
	In order to have a secure login system for our web aplication we can create a login filter using Proxy 
	which determines whether the login data entered was tried several times by the same user and failed.

Advantages of the solution:
	- One of the advantages of Proxy pattern is security;
	- This pattern avoids duplication of objects which might be huge size and memory;
	- The remote proxy also ensures about security by installing the local code proxy (stub) in the client machine and then accessing the server with help of the remote code.
	
Disadvantages of the solution:
	- A proxy can mask the life-cycle and state of a volatile resource from its client.
	- The pattern may have an impact on unit testing procedures.
	- If a proxy is used to represent a remote resource in the local process, this can disguise the fact that remote communication is involved.
