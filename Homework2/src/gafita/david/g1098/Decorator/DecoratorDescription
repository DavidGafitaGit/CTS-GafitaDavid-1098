Bachelor topic title:
	Stock Price Prediction System (Web application)
	
Description of the problem:
	In order to easily modify an already created stock we can use Decorator.
	In this case we have added a maximum and a minimum limit that a stock can reach. If the stock reaches the upper or lower limit, the event is reported that it must be closed.

Advantages of the solution:
    - high degree of flexibility;
    - expansion of function of classes without inheritance;
    - readable program code.
	
Disadvantages of the solution:
    - high complexity of software (especially decorator interface);
    - not beginner-friendly;
    - high number of objects.
